About the job
Description

At Zego, we know that traditional motor insurance holds good drivers back. It's too complicated, too expensive, and it doesn't take into account how well you actually drive. 

That's why, since 2016, we've been on a mission to change all of that. Our mission at Zego is to offer the lowest priced insurance for good drivers.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they're at the heart of everything we do.

We've sold tens of millions of policies so far, and raised over $200 million in funding. And we're only just getting started.

Who we're looking for

We are looking for a highly motivated Data Scientist, who is keen on building advanced predictive models and joining our growing Core Pricing team. The mission is to build a world-class Data Science team that turns ideas and resolves complex challenges into production-grade pricing and risk models effectively, safely, and consistently.

What you'll do

Explore & analyse large telematics, policy and quote datasets to uncover trends and opportunities
Build and validate statistical & machine learning models that power pricing and risk selection
Collaborate with Engineering, Actuarial and Product to frame business problems and productionise models
Communicate insights clearly through dashboards, visualisations and storytelling
Contribute to best practice in code review, experimentation and shaping our ways of working as you grow

What you'll bring

Recently completed (or soon to complete) Bachelor's or Master's in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Economics or a related quantitative field
Strong grounding in probability, statistics and machine learning fundamentals
Working knowledge of Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit‑learn), and basic SQL
Curiosity, problem‑solving mindset and the ability to present complex ideas simply
Right to work in the UK


Nice to have (but not essential)

Internship or course project involving real‑world data analysis or modelling
Familiarity with cloud platforms (e.g. AWS) and version control (git)
Experience with BI / visualisation tools (e.g. Looker)
